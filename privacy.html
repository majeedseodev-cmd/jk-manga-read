                <h3>About the Author: Domic</h3>
                <p>Ryomen Sukuna serves as the primary antagonist in the Jujutsu Kaisen manga. Known as the King of Curses, he embodies unparalleled power from the Heian Era. His character draws from Japanese mythology, portraying a figure of immense malice.</p>
                
                <h4>Origins</h4>
                <p>Sukuna originated as a human sorcerer during Japan's Heian Era (794-1185), a peak period for jujutsu sorcery fueled by rampant negative energy. Born with a mutant form featuring four arms, two faces, and two mouths after consuming his twin in the womb, he faced rejection and embraced a path of cannibalism and slaughter. Over a thousand years ago, he dominated as the strongest sorcerer until sorcerers sealed him into his 20 fingers as cursed objects.</p>
                
                <h4>Appearance</h4>
                <p>Sukuna's true form includes four arms, four eyes, and distinctive black tattoos marking his body, often described as demonic. When incarnated in Yuji Itadori, he manifests with extra mouths and eyes, enabling seamless hand signs and chants during battle. His design reflects his mythical inspiration from the Nihon Shoki.</p>
                
                <h4>Powers</h4>
                <p>Sukuna wields Dismantle for slashing inanimate targets, Cleave for adapting cuts to living foes, and his Domain Expansion Malevolent Shrine devastates surroundings. He employs Reverse Cursed Technique for regeneration, can summon Mahoraga, and uses world-splitting slashes targeting space itself. Additional abilities include chanting while fighting and domain amplification to counter other techniques.</p>
                
                <h4>Role in Story</h4>
                <p>Sukuna incarnates through Yuji consuming his fingers, frequently seizing control to battle foes like Jogo and Mahoraga in events such as the Shibuya Incident. He later possesses Megumi Fushiguro's body via a ritual by Uraume, his loyal Heian Era servant. His tragic aversion to emotional bonds, including rejecting love from Yorozu and Uraume, fuels his villainy.</p>
