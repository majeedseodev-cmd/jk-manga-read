                <h2>Featured Topics</h2>
                <p>Domic's expertise centers on the rich world of Jujutsu Kaisen, with particular focus on its most compelling character: Ryomen Sukuna. Below is an extensive exploration of this pivotal antagonist.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Ryomen Sukuna: The King of Curses</h2>
                <p>Ryomen Sukuna serves as the primary antagonist in the Jujutsu Kaisen manga. Known as the King of Curses, he embodies unparalleled power from the Heian Era. His character draws from Japanese mythology, portraying a figure of immense malice that has fascinated readers since the series began.</p>
                
                <h3>Origins</h3>
                <p>Sukuna originated as a human sorcerer during Japan's Heian Era (794-1185), a peak period for jujutsu sorcery fueled by rampant negative energy. Born with a mutant form featuring four arms, two faces, and two mouths after consuming his twin in the womb, he faced rejection and embraced a path of cannibalism and slaughter. Over a thousand years ago, he dominated as the strongest sorcerer until sorcerers sealed him into his 20 fingers as cursed objects.</p>
                
                <p>The historical context of Sukuna's origin adds layers of meaning to his character. The Heian Era represents both cultural refinement and supernatural darkness in Japanese history, making it the perfect backdrop for the rise of such a formidable curse. His transformation from human to curse speaks to themes of rejection, power, and the consequences of unchecked ambition.</p>
                
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Sukuna's true form includes four arms, four eyes, and distinctive black tattoos marking his body, often described as demonic. When incarnated in Yuji Itadori, he manifests with extra mouths and eyes, enabling seamless hand signs and chants during battle. His design reflects his mythical inspiration from the Nihon Shoki.</p>
                
                <p>The visual design choices Gege Akutami made for Sukuna communicate his nature immediately. The additional limbs and facial features suggest otherworldly power, while the tattoos create an instantly recognizable silhouette. These artistic decisions ensure Sukuna commands attention in every panel where he appears.</p>
                
                <h3>Powers</h3>
                <p>Sukuna wields Dismantle for slashing inanimate targets, Cleave for adapting cuts to living foes, and his Domain Expansion Malevolent Shrine devastates surroundings. He employs Reverse Cursed Technique for regeneration, can summon Mahoraga, and uses world-splitting slashes targeting space itself. Additional abilities include chanting while fighting and domain amplification to counter other techniques.</p>
                
                <p>The versatility of Sukuna's abilities makes him a compelling threat throughout the series. Unlike many antagonists who rely on a single overwhelming power, Sukuna demonstrates tactical intelligence in how he applies his diverse skill set. His ability to adapt to any combat situation keeps readers uncertain about outcomes whenever he takes the stage.</p>
                
                <h3>Role in the Story</h3>
                <p>Sukuna incarnates through Yuji consuming his fingers, frequently seizing control to battle foes like Jogo and Mahoraga in events such as the Shibuya Incident. He later possesses Megumi Fushiguro's body via a ritual by Uraume, his loyal Heian Era servant. His tragic aversion to emotional bonds, including rejecting love from Yorozu and Uraume, fuels his villainy.</p>
                
                <p>Sukuna's presence shapes the entire narrative of Jujutsu Kaisen. His fingers drive early plot developments as characters race to collect them before greater harm can occur. His occasional emergence during battles demonstrates power levels that redefine what readers thought possible in this world. And his ultimate plans create stakes that affect every character in the series.</p>
